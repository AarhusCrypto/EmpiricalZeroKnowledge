	RTZ14 - Circuit Sat Zero Knowledge


************************************************************


This project offers an executable {rtz14} that implements our protocol
for proving knowledge of a witness {x} satisfying a circuit {C}. In
more detail, a Prover can with this software beyond reasonable doubt,
and for any circuit {C} with one output, convince a Verifier that
(s)he knows a satisfying assignment to the input gates of {C}.

In test/AES we present an example circuit for Advances Encryption
Standard (AES). With this circuit the Prover proves that he has
knowledge the Key that encrypts the all zero plain-text to a
particular ciphertext. More precisely, the cipher-text obtained from
encrypting with the all zero key as well. Thus running {rtz14} as
prover with this circuit and witness all zeros yields an accepting
Verifier.

The Soundness (probability that a cheating Prover wins) is
one-half. Thus to obtain security k-bits (e.g. lowing the probability
a cheating prover wins to 2^{-k}) we repeat the protocol {k} times.
